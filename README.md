This work proposes several new methods to derive inter-lingual document represen-tations (Marc-lenz and Tsegaye Misikir). 
these methods aim to enhance the quality content-based Multilingual Document Recommendation Systems. 
The main idea centers around creating inter-lingualrepresentations by using mappings to align monolingual representation spaces.

- evaluation_functions.py - Contains different functions which create, train, and evaluate models. (mainly used inside the Jupyter Notebooks)
- Preprocessor.py - Preprocessing Class used to preprocess text of different languages.
- Utils.py - containing smaller auxilary functions
