# Thesis Code


This Repository corresponds to the Master Thesis "Learning Multiligual Docment Representations"

(Marc Lenz, 2021)

----

This thesis proposes several new methods to derive inter-lingual document represen-tations. 
these methods aim to enhance the quality content-based Multilingual Docu-ment Recommendation Systems. 
The main idea centers around creating inter-lingualrepresentations by using mappings to align monolingual representation spaces.

The repo contains the following:

- Jupyter_Notebooks_Colab - Jupyter Notebooks which were used for the main evaluations of the thesis.
- evaluation_functions.py - Contains different functions which create, train, and evaluate models. (mainly used inside the Jupyter Notebooks)
- Preprocessor.py - Preprocessing Class used to preprocess text of different languages.
- Utils.py - containing smaller auxilary functions
